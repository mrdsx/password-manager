# Password Manager

This is my Password Manager App. I'm currently developing it as the side project. The key features of this app are:
 - creating/editing (SOON)/deleting passwords with corresponding login
 - search among passwords by login (SOON)
 - creating/editing/deleting other types of secure info (such as Card/Identity/Secure note) (SOON)
 - creating/editing/deleting folders (SOON)
 - creating custom fields for items (SOON)
